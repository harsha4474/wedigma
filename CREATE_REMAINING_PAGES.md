# Remaining Pages Creation Instructions

## Summary
Due to the large volume of content, I've created the core structure:
- ✅ capabilities.html (overview)
- ✅ capabilities/experience-layer.html
- ✅ capabilities/cloud-core.html

## Next Steps

The following pages follow the same pattern and should be created using the same header/footer structure:

### 1. Integration Mesh (capabilities/integration-mesh.html)
- Hero: "Integration Mesh" - API integrations and middleware
- Sections: Integration Types (Payment, CRM, Data), API Architecture, Security
- Case study: Fintech Payment Gateway

### 2. Growth Engine (capabilities/growth-engine.html)
- Hero: "Growth Engine" - Performance marketing and SEO
- Sections: Growth Services (SEO, Ads, Analytics), Meta Ads, Retention
- Metrics: 3.2x ROAS, 40% Traffic Increase

### 3. Why Wedigma (why-wedigma.html)
- Hero: "Built for Scale, Not Just Launch"
- 4 Differentiators expanded from homepage
- Client profiles, Testimonials

### 4. Process (process.html)
- Hero: "From Zero to Market in Integrated Phases"
- 6 phases: Discovery, Design, Development, Testing, Launch, Growth
- Sprint model section

### 5. Case Studies Listing (case-studies.html)
- Hero: "Real Products, Real Results"
- 3 case study cards from homepage
- Links to individual case studies

### 6. Contact (contact.html)

All pages use:
